# Perceptron Animation Project

This project demonstrates the **Perceptron Learning Algorithm** using Python, with a visual animation to illustrate how the perceptron learns to classify points. The animation is saved as an MP4 file so users can easily view the perceptron's learning process.

---

## Project Contents

- `Perceptron.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Python code implementing the perceptron algorithm
  - Step-by-step explanations and plots
- `perceptron_animation.mp4` – Animation of the perceptron in action
- `README.md` – Project description and instructions

---

## Features

- Visualizes perceptron learning and weight updates
- Shows decision boundary adjusting as new points are processed
- Includes an animation for better understanding of the learning process

---

## How to View on GitHub

- Open `Perceptron.ipynb` to see the code, explanations, and plots.
- Click `perceptron_animation.mp4` to watch the animation directly in the browser.
